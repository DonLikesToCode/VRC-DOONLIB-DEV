THINGS TO ADD:

- Helper functions/legit anything that I can find useful in the DOON_MAIN.h header file namespace.

- Possibly specific PID inherits

Odometry:
- Enable users to use versatile setups/configs
Best: 1 vertical, 1 horizontal, 1 imu 
Good: 1 vertical, 1 imu, traction wheels
Bad: 1 imu, traction wheels
Worst: 1 imu, no traction wheels

Also may include arc approximation and line approximation versions.

- Pure Pursuit Class
